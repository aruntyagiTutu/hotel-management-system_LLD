Topic for the video: Low-Level Design of a Hotel Management System

In the last video, we covered the following steps:

Grouped related classes and identified their properties and functionalities, forming the basis for our UML diagram.
Created skeleton classes based on the UML diagram, with empty methods to establish the design framework.
