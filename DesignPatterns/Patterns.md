1. Factory Pattern:
Use Case: Creating different types of bookings, rooms, or payment methods.
Example: You can use a factory to generate room types (deluxe, suite, etc.) or payment methods based on the userâ€™s selection. It abstracts the creation process and promotes loose coupling.
2. Strategy Pattern:
Use Case: Handling various pricing models, discount calculations, or cancellation policies.
Example: Different pricing strategies for peak season, weekday versus weekend pricing, or customer loyalty discounts can be applied without modifying the booking process.
3. Observer Pattern:
Use Case: Notifying users or subsystems about room availability, booking status changes, or promotions.
Example: Notify customers when a room they want becomes available or when a booking is confirmed or canceled. Also, use it to trigger other actions like sending emails or updates to the system.
4. Decorator Pattern:
Use Case: Adding optional services or features (e.g., breakfast, airport pickup, or spa services) to a booking.
Example: Decorators allow you to dynamically add these features to a booking object, keeping the core booking class flexible and easy to extend.
5. Singleton Pattern:
Use Case: Managing resources that should only have a single instance, such as a logging system, database connections, or the booking system manager.
Example: Ensure that there's only one instance of the booking manager that handles reservations to avoid conflicts or double bookings.
6. Adapter Pattern:
Use Case: Integrating external systems like payment gateways, third-party booking platforms, or external room availability systems.
Example: Use adapters to integrate third-party services like PayPal or external APIs for room availability without modifying the core system logic.
7. Command Pattern:
Use Case: Handling user actions (e.g., book a room, cancel a booking, modify a reservation) in a decoupled way.
Example: Encapsulate these actions as command objects, making it easy to undo, redo, or log actions as needed.
8. State Pattern:
Use Case: Managing the various states of a booking (e.g., reserved, confirmed, checked-in, checked-out, canceled).
Example: A booking can transition between states like pending, confirmed, or canceled, and each state may have specific behaviors and rules.
9. Proxy Pattern:
Use Case: Providing controlled access to sensitive resources, like accessing external hotel systems or managing expensive database operations.
Example: Use a proxy to control access to a remote server handling the booking and inventory to reduce load and improve security.
10. Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
Use Case: Handling complex validation or processing logic for booking requests, like checking room availability, applying discounts, and processing payments.
Example: Process booking requests through a series of handlers (e.g., validation, payment, confirmation), where each handler performs a specific task before passing it to the next one.
11. Repository Pattern:
Use Case: Abstracting data access and managing room availability, customer details, and bookings in the database.
Example: Use repositories to encapsulate the logic required to access and manipulate data sources, making the system more maintainable and testable.
12. Template Method Pattern:
Use Case: Defining the skeleton of an algorithm for booking a room but allowing certain steps to be modified by subclasses.
Example: Different types of bookings (online, phone, walk-in) could follow the same basic flow but allow certain steps (like payment or room assignment) to be customized.
